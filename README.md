This repository includes the algorithm (Random Forest) that was developed to estimate pasture properties of Portuguese Sown biodiverse pastures rich in legumes (SBP) derived from Sentinel-2 data. The considered properties are:
- Standing biomass (kg/ha)
- Legumes fraction (-)
- Nitrogen content (g/kg)
- Phosphorus content (g/kg)

# Usage
- Requires scikit-learn library
- Requires joblib library
- Download folder "models" folder
- Prepare input data (see raw data file used in "Raw data folder"
- Use the individual models in the "models" folder using the input data file
